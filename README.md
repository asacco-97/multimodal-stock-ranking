# Multimodal Stock Ranking 📈
The Multimodal Stock Ranking project aims to combine multiple data sources—financial news, historical stock data, and other market indicators—to build a model that ranks stocks. The goal is to predict stock performance by leveraging different modalities of data (e.g., news sentiment, historical prices) for better investment decision-making.

# ⚙️ Pipeline Overview
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Raw Data**: Collects stock prices and financial news headlines stored in `data/raw/`.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes the data, preparing it for use in the model. This processed data is saved in `data/processed/`.
- **Embeddings**: We utilize FinBERT or other pre-trained models to convert news headlines into 768-dimensional embeddings stored in `data/embeddings/`.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Create a Virtual Environment
To set up a Python environment for this project, you can use `venv` or `conda`:

Using venv:
```{bash}
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .env\Scripts\activate
```
Using conda:
```{bash}
conda create --name multimodal-stock-ranking python=3.8
conda activate multimodal-stock-ranking
```

2. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```{bash}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the necessary packages, such as:
- transformers for working with pre-trained models like FinBERT
- scikit-learn, xgboost for machine learning
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

3. Running the Pipeline

🔮 Future Work
This project is designed to be expanded in various ways, including the following areas:

Incorporating Additional Market Indicators:

Add inflation indicators, bond yield data, and other macroeconomic indicators to improve stock ranking predictions.

Improving the Model:

Experiment with more sophisticated multimodal deep learning models (e.g., transformers for multimodal fusion) to improve prediction accuracy.

Real-Time Data:

Extend the pipeline to support real-time data for live stock ranking, making it suitable for day trading or real-time investment strategies.

Cross-Asset Ranking:

Expand the model to rank not only stocks but also other asset classes, such as ETFs, bonds, and cryptocurrencies.

📊 Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision and Recall

F1 Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics are important for assessing how well the model ranks stocks based on sentiment and other features.
